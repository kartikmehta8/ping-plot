### Ping Plot
This Python script uses the ping command to continuously measure and visualize the latency of an IP address in real-time. It provides insights into network performance, making it useful for `network monitoring`, `troubleshooting`, and `analyzing latency trends` over time.

### Test the Script
```py
ip_address = input('Enter IP address to ping: ') # 8.8.8.8
duration = int(input('Enter duration to ping (in seconds): ')) # 20
```
